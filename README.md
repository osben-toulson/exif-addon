## About

This project is an Adobe Express add-on that allows users to upload an image and automatically extract its EXIF metadata (such as camera, shutter speed, ISO, lens, and focal length) if available. The add-on displays the extracted EXIF data in editable fields, and users can apply this information as text fields directly into their Adobe Express document. The add-on is built using Spectrum Web Components and JavaScript, leveraging the Adobe Express Add-on SDK for seamless integration.
